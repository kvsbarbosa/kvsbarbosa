## **Stack:**

I mainly use Java and Python, storing data in PostgreSQL and MySQL. I build APIs with Spring Boot (Python's FastApi too), covering security, JPA, MVC, and testing using JUnit and Mockito, and I work with Maven.  Additionally, I'm gradually improving my skills in Python for task automation. Also, diving into AWS Cloud Computing.

That's it.
